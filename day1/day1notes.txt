. WORKING WITH VARIABLES IN POTHON TO MANAGE DATA
.PRINTING Commenting debugging string manipulation and variables

task is to generate a band name generator program

print("hello world")
hello world
the file location is : C:\Users\ganes\PycharmProjects\pythonProject4\.venv\Scripts\python.exe C:\Users\ganes\PycharmProjects\pythonProject4\day1.py 


~ indicates to have a new line
"\n" : it leads us to a new line
      eg:print("hello world!\nhello world!")
           hello world!
           hello world!
within the print statement we can also concatenate the strings  
    i.e print("hello" + "world!")
      o/p: helloworld!
    2.i.e print("hello" +" "+"world!")
      o/p: hello world!


python has indent feature 
if we miss align the code it rises INDENTATION ERROR

input: it is the keyword where it accepts any kind of input from the user
 	input("what is your name?")
	what is your name?ganesh
-->print("hello "+ input("what is ur name?"))
what is ur name?ganesh
hello ganesh	
--> by using "#" we can write comments
-->  ctrl + /  : can make a line of code to a comment


to store the data temporarily within the code we use varuiables
  eg: name = input("what is ur name?")
	print(name)
o/p: what is ur name? ganesh
     ganesh


we can alsoassign values to the variables i.e  name="ganesh"

case: name="ganesh"
      print(name)
      name="ramu"
      print(name) 
the o/p is :  ganesh
	      ramu
here same variable contains the 2 diff values

but in this case
name="ganesh"
name="ramu"
print(name)
o/p : ramu 
coz of priority of the assignment

to get the length of a string or value in variable "len()" is used

	eg: name="ganesh sai alla"
                   print(len(name))

		o/p: 15
we will get same o/p as : print(len(input("your name?")))
