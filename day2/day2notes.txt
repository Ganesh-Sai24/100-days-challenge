--------TO DEVELOP TIP CALCULATOR----------

UNDERSTANDING DATATYPES AND STRING MANIPULATION

#subscripting
i/p : print("hello"[0])
o/p : h
as the indexing starts from 0...
i/p : print("hello"[4])
o/p : o
i/p : print("hello"[-1])  # to get last character 
o/p : o

if we place anything within the " "  it is considered as string
print("123"+"456")
o/p : 123456

#integer

i/p : print(123,456,789)
o/p : 123 456 789

i/p : print(123_456_789)
o/p : 123456789

#float numbers

print(1.43)
1.43

#boolean  this has inly two values that is either "true" or "false"

note : len() wont work for integers 

to check the datatype of any particular variable or object we use "type()" function  
   eg: print(type("hello"))
    o/p: <class 'str'>  

##type casting :
it is the process of converting or changing one datatype to another datatype
print(int("123")+int("123"))
o/p: 246
tough "123" is string we casted it to as integer type.


name=input("Enter your name: ")
length = len(name)
print("Number of letters in your name: ", length)

o/p:  Enter your name: ganesh sai
Number of letters in your name:  10

python implicitly consider a number in divison as float type.
but while performing floor divison it results integer


when we have multiple arthimetic operations we follow  PEMDAS  rule
paranthesis
exponent
multiplication
division
addition
subtraction

let x=123.43435546
i/p: print(round(123.43435546))
o/p: 123
 round()  fxn accepts 2 inputs that are number want to round & no.of digits want to round
 

Assignmennt Operators : 
	
+=
-=
*=
/=

score = 0

# User scores a point
score += 1
print(score)

#Also
score -= 1
score *= 2
score /= 2

score = 0
height = 1.8
is_winning = True

print(f"Your score is = {score}, your height is {height}. You are winning is {is_winning}")


 o/p : 1
       Your score is = 0, your height is 1.8. You are winning is True


final project of day_2:


	print("Welcome to the tip calculator!")
bill = float(input("What was the total bill? $"))
tip = int(input("What percentage tip would you like to give? 10 12 15 "))
people = int(input("How many people to split the bill? "))
tip_as_percent = tip / 100
total_tip_amount = bill * tip_as_percent
total_bill = bill + total_tip_amount
bill_per_person = total_bill / people
final_amount = round(bill_per_person, 2)
print(f"Each person should pay: ${final_amount}")

o/p:	Welcome to the tip calculator!
What was the total bill? $500
What percentage tip would you like to give? 10 12 15 10
How many people to split the bill? 5
Each person should pay: $110.0
